# PyBer_Analysis

# Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to analyze data for PyBer, a ridesharing company.  
The analysis time frame is from January to early May of 2019 and data sets include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

# Results:

The summary DataFrame by city type indicates both the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is significantly lower for urban cities due to the high number of drivers availability.

# Summary:

 - An increase in any amount of rides for rural cities has the potential for significant upside revenue growth due to the high average fare per ride in this area.
 - Urban cities are best performing at all data points. These cities have a vital role in the profitability company.  
 - Increase recruiting, marketing efforts, and other incentives to increase the market size in rural areas. This both to attract new business and maintain loyalty with existing business partners, drivers and riders.
